# How to configure PowerShell
I have been using PowerShell daily for a while now, and here are the basic configurations for a fresh Win 10 build.

## Laying the groundwork  
Do all of this in Windows PowerShell, then you can switch to the console front end of your choice. I have been using the [Windows Terminal Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701), and enjoy it so far. Prettier and simpler than cmder.

### Enable remote signed
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Scoop
Scoop is a wonderful way to manage all of your local software.
```powershell
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
scoop install git aria2 mremoteng pshazz sharex telegram vim vscode
scoop bucket add extras
```

### Install PowerShell Core/PowerShell Preview 
Just for fun, it is nice to have the latest versions around...
```powershell
iex "& { $(irm https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1) } -UseMSI"
iex "& { $(irm https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1) } -UseMSI -Preview"
```

### Create profile
And then you need to set up a profile to do all the cool things you want to do.
```powershell
New-Item -path $profile -type file â€“force
```

### Pull down some libs
```powershell
Install-PackageProvider NuGet -MinimumVersion '2.8.5.201' -Force -Scope CurrentUser
Set-PSRepository -Name PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted
Install-Module -Name 'posh-git' -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module -Name 'oh-my-posh' -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module -Name 'Get-ChildItemColor' -Scope CurrentUser
```
